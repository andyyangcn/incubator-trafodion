<<<
[[SQL-1025]]
== SQL 1025

```
Request failed. Dependent object <object-name> exists.
```

*Cause:* This error can occur when you drop a constraint, index, or
table. These objects cannot be dropped if they have dependent objects
and the drop-behavior is RESTRICT.

*Effect:* {project-name} does not perform the
operation.

*Recovery:* For DROP statements that support the CASCADE drop-behavior,
you can reissue the statement specifying CASCADE. For other DROP
statements, you must first drop each of the dependent objects, then drop
the object.

[[SQL-1027]]
== SQL 1027

```
The view <view-name> was created before column privileges were supported. To grant column privileges, please recreate the view.
```

Where <view-name> is the name of the view
specified.

*Cause:* You attempted to grant column privileges on a view that was created
on an earlier release of the {project-name} software, before column privileges were supported.

*Effect:* No column privileges were granted.

*Recovery:* If you wish to execute the query, resubmit without
the DISPLAY command.

[[SQL-1034]]
== SQL 1034

```
Unable to obtain privileges.
```

*Cause:* You attempted a DDL or GRANT/REVOKE operation but {project-name}
could not retrieve privilege information needed to process the request.
Additional error messages may give insight to the cause.

*Effect:* The operation is not executed.

*Recovery:* None. Contact the {project-name} Developer Distribution List.

<<<
[[SQL-1035]]
== SQL 1035

```

```

Where <auth-id-1> is the authorization ID performing the GRANT.

Where <auth-id-2> is the authorization ID that is the target of the GRANT.

*Cause:* There is a chain of grants leading from <auth-id-2> back to <auth-id-1>. Granting
this request might create a circular dependency.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* None.

<<<
[[SQL-1037]]
== SQL 1037

```
Revoke failed because of a dependent grant between authorization ID <auth-id-1> and authorization ID <auth-id-2>.
```

Where <auth-id-1> and <auth-id-2> are authorization IDs.

*Cause:* You attempted to revoke a privilege from <auth-id-1>, but 
that user or role has granted that privilege to a third authorization ID.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Reconnect to the {project-name} database using an authorization ID
that can revoke the dependent privileges, then reconnect again under the
original authorization ID and resubmit.

[[SQL-1039]]
== SQL 1039

```
No privileges were revoked. You lack the grant option for the specified privilege(s).
```

*Cause:* You attempted to revoke privileges from an authorization ID, but you do not
have the ability (grant option) to perform this operation.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Reconnect to the {project-name} database using an authorization ID
that has grant option for these privileges and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-1040]]
== SQL 1040

```
The use of ALTER on metadata tables is not permitted.
```

*Cause:* An ALTER TABLE statement was issued naming a table that is part
of the {project-name} database metadata. Such tables cannot be altered.

[[SQL-1043]]
== SQL 1043

```
Constraint <constraint-name> already exists.
```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* You assigned the same constraint name to two constraints on the
same table. Constraint names must be unique among all the constraints
for a table.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Make all the constraint names for the table unique. Use
SHOWDDL to see the names of existing constraints.

[[SQL-1044]]
== SQL 1044

```
Constraint <constraint-name> could not be created because the referenced columns in the referenced table are not part of a unique constraint.
```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* The columns that <constraint-name> references in the referenced
table are not part of a unique constraint.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that <constraint-name> references a unique or primary
constraint in the referenced table.

<<<
[[SQL-1045]]
== SQL 1045

```
The unique constraint cannot be used because it is deferrable.
```

*Cause:* The referential constraint is referencing the unique constraint
that is declared as deferrable. This is an internal error.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that the referential constraint references a unique
constraint that is not declared deferrable. Contact the {project-name} User
Distribution List

[[SQL-1046]]
== SQL 1046

```
Referenced and referencing column lists do not match for constraint <constraint-name>.
```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* The list of referencing columns in <constraint-name> does not
match the list of unique key columns that it is referencing.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

matches the list of referenced columns.

<<<
[[SQL-1047]]
== SQL 1047

```
Request failed. Dependent view <view-name> exists.
```

Where <view-name> is the name of the view on the object being dropped.

*Cause:* An object that has a dependent view cannot be dropped unless
you use the CASCADE option on the DROP statement.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* To drop the object and all its dependent objects, you can
either drop each of the dependent objects using individual DROP
statements before dropping the object itself, or use the CASCADE clause
on the DROP statement for the object.

[[SQL-1048]]
== SQL 1048

```
The statement currently supports only RESTRICT behavior.
```

*Cause:* Drop behavior CASCADE was specified on a DROP statement that
supports only RESTRICT drop behavior.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Reissue the DROP statement, specifying RESTRICT or omitting
the drop behavior (which will default to RESTRICT).

<<<
[[SQL-1049]]
== SQL 1049

```
Constraint cannot be dropped because it was specified to be NOT DROPPABLE.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to drop a constraint that is NOT DROPPABLE.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* None.

[[SQL-1050]]
== SQL 1050

```
Constraint cannot be dropped because it is used as a referenced object for a foreign key.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to drop a unique or primary constraint, with
dependent referential constraints, using the RESTRICT option, which does
not remove such constraints.

*Effect:* The drop command fails.

*Recovery:* If you want to drop the dependent referential constraints,
use the CASCADE option for the DROP CONSTRAINT command.

<<<
[[SQL-1051]]
== SQL 1051

```
You do not have the required privilege(s) on <object-name>.
```

Where <object-name> is the name of the object for which you have
insufficient privileges.

table you specified. Correct the name and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-1053]]
== SQL 1053

```
Unique index <index-name> could not be created because the specified column(s) contain duplicate data.
```

Where <index-name> is the name specified for the index to create.

*Cause:* The rows already existing in the table violate the uniqueness
constraint specified in the CREATE INDEX statement.

*Effect:* The index is not created.

*Recovery:* Either change the list of columns for the unique index, or
change the rows in the table to remove duplicates. Then reissue the
statement.

[[SQL-1055]]
== SQL 1055

```
Object <component-name> already exists.
```

Where <component-name> is a component name you specified on a REGISTER COMPONENT statement.

*Cause:* You attempted to register a new component in the 
{project-name} database but this component already exists.

*Effect:* The operation takes no action.

*Recovery:* If the component name is incorrect, correct and resubmit.

*Recovery:* Consult the descriptions of the accompanying warning messages.

<<<
[[SQL-1069]]
== SQL 1069

```
Schema <schema-name> could not be dropped. <details>
```

Where <schema-name> is the name of a {project-name} database schema.

Where <details> is additional message text giving details concerning
why the schema could not be dropped.

*Cause:* The cause is given in the <details>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* The <details> may offer insights. Possibly there is an
inconsistency between HBase and the {project-name} metadata. The
CLEANUP SCHEMA command may be used to recover in these cases.

*Recovery:* Use the CLEANUP SCHEMA <schema-name> command to drop anything remaining.

[[SQL-1080]]
== SQL 1080

```
The DDL request has duplicate references to column <column-name>.
```

Where <column-name> is the name of a column of a table.

*Cause:* You attempted to create a table or view that has two columns with the
same name. If you name a column "SYSKEY," duplication can result from
the implicit creation by the {project-name} database software of a column
named SYSKEY to ensure uniqueness for the clustering key.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Remove duplicate column names and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-1081]]
== SQL 1081

```
Loading of index <index-name> failed unexpectedly.
```

Where <index-name> is the name of the index being populated.

*Cause:* Population of the index failed, either because another
concurrent operation was being performed on the base table or because
data could not be loaded into the index by the Call-level interface
(CLI).

```
An invalid default value was specified for column <column-name>.
```

Where <column-name> is the specified column.

*Cause:* An invalid default value was specified in the column definition
for <column-name>.

*Effect:* Creation of the table or addition of the column fails.

*Recovery:* Specify a valid default value for the column and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-1089]]
== SQL 1089

```
The system generated column SYSKEY must be specified last or not specified at all in the index column list.
```

*Cause:* The system-generated SYSKEY column was not the last column in a
CREATE INDEX statement.

Where <table-name> is the name of the table.

*Cause:* When the Partition Overlay Support feature is enabled without
setting volume names (through CQD POS_LOCATIONS) for table partitions to
reside on, location names are generated automatically. However, the
{project-name} database software could not generate the location names
automatically, and because the CQD POS_RAISE_ERROR is not set, the given

Where <directory> is the {project-name} platform subvolume name specified in
the LOCATION clause of the CREATE SCHEMA command.

Where <schema> is the ANSI name of an existing schema that already uses
<directory> as a schema subvolume.

*Cause:* In a CREATE SCHEMA command, you specified <directory> in the
LOCATION clause; however, this subvolume is already being used as schema
subvolume by <schema>.

*Effect:* The statement fails unless it includes the optional REUSE
clause to allow reuse of the same schema subvolume name. If the REUSE
clause is used, this is a warning message and the schema is created
successfully. The warning can be issued repeatedly for a single CREATE
SCHEMA command if multiple schemas already exist with <directory> as the
schema subvolume.

*Recovery:* Only schemas that are RDF replicated to another node should
have the same subvolume names as their corresponding schemas on the
other node. To create these, use the optional REUSE clause in the CREATE
SCHEMA statement. All other schemas should have unique subvolume names.
Schemas that are, or will be, related as RDF primary and backup schemas
must have identical schema names and subvolumes on the primary and
backup nodes.
