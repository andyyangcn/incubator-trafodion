[[install-ambari]]
= Install with Ambari

This method of installation uses RPM packages rather than tar files. There are two packages:

* traf_ambari - Ambari management pack (plug-in) that is installed on the Ambari Server node
* apache-trafodion_server - Trafodion package that is installed on every data node

You can either set up a local yum repository (requires a web server) or install the RPMs
manually on each node.

== Local Repository

On your web server host, be sure the *createrepo* package is installed.
Copy the two RPM files into a directory served to the web and run the createrepo command.

 $ createrepo -d .

The command must be used to update repo meta-data any time new RPMs are added or replaced.

Note the Trafodion repository URL for later use.

== Install Ambari Management Pack for Trafodion

On your Ambari server host:

. If Ambari Server is not already installed, be sure to download a yum repo file for Ambari.
For example: http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.4.2.0/bk_ambari-installation/content/download_the_ambari_repo_lnx6.html[Ambari-2.4.2 repo].

. Add a yum repo file with the URL of your local repository, or copy the traf_ambari RPM locally.

. Install the Trafodion Ambari management pack RPM. Ambari server will be installed as a dependency, if not already installed.

 $ sudo yum install traf_ambari

. Set-up Ambari
.. If Ambari server was previously running, restart it.

 $ sudo ambari-server restart

.. If Ambari server was not previously running, initialize and start it.

 $ sudo ambari-server setup
 ...
 $ sudo ambari-server start

== Install Trafodion

Unlike the command-line installer, Trafodion can be provisioned at time of creating a new cluster.

=== Initial Cluster Creation

If you are creating a new cluster and you have the Trafodion server RPM hosted on a local yum repository, then
create the cluster as normal, and select Trafodion on the service selection screen.
When Ambari prompts for the repository URLs, be sure to update the Trafodion URL
to the URL for your local repository.

If you plan to install the server RPM manually, do not select the Trafodion service. First, create a cluster
without Trafodion service and follow instructions for an existing cluster.

=== Existing Cluster

If you are not using a local yum repository, manually copy the apache-trafodion_server RPM to each data node and
install it using yum install.

Using Ambari, select the cluster and then choose "Add a Service" and select Trafodion.
